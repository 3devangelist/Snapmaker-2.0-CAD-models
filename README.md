# Snapmaker-2.0-CAD-models
Reverse Engineered Simple CAD model Of the new Snapmaker Eco-System

The goal is to have community support CAD models to create the add-ons that we see fit!  Like always, these companies don't support the community, and we, have to resource the information with hour means.

This Suck !! but is what we have to deal with!
I am using Fusion 360 and, I think that if you want to help you should use the same software for we can commute between files. 
I am starting on the basics! we should model all the parts with the minimal information that it should be needed to make parts or hacks to the machine!
Please use the minimal features to the max modelling, less is more this case is more because fewer features less ram is needed and rebuilding is faster! don't model treads, please!
